# Rock-Paper-Scissor
A classic game against a computer (3 out of 5 rounds to win)

JavaScript:
1. Learned about basic loops (for-loops, while-loops, if/else-if/else loops)
2. Created functions and called functions (outputs) to execute/run the game
3. Optimized user input by making it case-insensitive and made computer choose random game objects
